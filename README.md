# TextToMorse
A small Processing sketch that converts text messages to morse
Compile and run using Processing 3.5.3

This Processing sketch was a 1 afternoon project and "challenge" to myself.

This skecth opens a window that flashes black and white to reproduce a message in Morse code.
This message can be anything, and can be changed in the global Variable "BroadcastMessage"

It can display any of these characters:
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz ABCEDFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ 1234567890 .,?'!/()&:;=+-_\"$@
